# Cloudflare-DDNS
Powershell scripts to automatically update DNS records

Couldnt find any PS Scripts that actually worked, so heres mine :)

For multiple subdomains you can just use one script (Cloudflare-args.ps1) and run it like so

```email apikey zoneid type(a/aaaa) recordname (url to get ip)```
